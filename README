                       BUILDING THE LIBRARY

REQUIREMENTS
    * A Java SDK in JAVA_HOME
    * Ant

CONFIGURATION
    Run ./configure, and optionally specify a prefix and libdir to use during
    installation.  For example,

        ./configure --prefix=/usr --libdir=/usr/lib64

    would result in the native library being installed in /usr/lib64, while the
    Jar file would reside in /usr/share/inotify-java/lib.

BUILDING
    Type 'make'.

    Assuming a successful build, the Jar file will be in src/java.  The native
    library will be in src/cpp.

INSTALLING
    Type 'make install'.

UNINSTALLING
    Likewise, 'make uninstall' is also supported.
